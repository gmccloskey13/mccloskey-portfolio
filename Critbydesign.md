# CRITIQUE BY DESIGN
Telling Stories With Data - Assignment 3/4

## Original Visualization
The original visualization I chose to critique comes from page 40 of the Digital Media Association’s (DiMA) Annual Music Report called [_Streaming Forward 2020_](https://15z58v1dk1tg360t7w3les8e-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DiMA_2020_Streaming_Forward_Report.pdf). I found this visualization while reading this report and it really stuck out to me. This visualization is the only image in the conclusion section and it is very crowded and busy with very little effective hierarchy. I personally did not know what to look at and had to keep reading in order to discover its full meaning. Overall, the visualization was not very effective as the last of a long report because of those reasons. My goal for this assignment was to clean this visualization up and offer the viewer all of the necessary information with the graph alone.

## Process
I started this journey by using Stephen Few's Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile. Through this method, I discovered a number of elements of the graph that I did not like and what I was drawn to first. I enjoyed this method because I was able to think about the seven different areas he discusses and how every element of visualization worked together. I knew from the critique method that I really wanted to streamline the visual and reduce all of the ‘noise’ that was taking away from the content, such as the loud orange and the big number block labels that, in my opinion, did not add to the effectiveness of the graph. One element of the critique that helped me understand how to rework this was considering the audience. This report appears to be aimed at a broad audience of those interested in the music industry general users of the platforms that belong to the association, such as Amazon, Apple, and Google. I believe that those reading the report may be interested in a high overview of the industry and not technical in language or content.
