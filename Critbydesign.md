# CRITIQUE BY DESIGN
Telling Stories With Data - Assignment 3/4

## Original Visualization
The original visualization I chose to critique comes from page 40 of the Digital Media Association’s (DiMA) Annual Music Report called [_Streaming Forward 2020_](https://15z58v1dk1tg360t7w3les8e-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DiMA_2020_Streaming_Forward_Report.pdf). I found this visualization while reading this report and it really stuck out to me. This visualization is the only image in the conclusion section and it is very crowded and busy with very little effective hierarchy. I personally did not know what to look at and had to keep reading in order to discover its full meaning. Overall, the visualization was not very effective as the last of a long report because of those reasons. My goal for this assignment was to clean this visualization up and offer the viewer all of the necessary information with the graph alone.

## Process
I started this journey by using Stephen Few's Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile. Through this method, I discovered a number of elements of the graph that I did not like and what I was drawn to first. I enjoyed this method because I was able to think about the seven different areas he discusses and how every element of visualization worked together. I knew from the critique method that I really wanted to streamline the visual and reduce all of the ‘noise’ that was taking away from the content, such as the loud orange and the big number block labels that, in my opinion, did not add to the effectiveness of the graph. One element of the critique that helped me understand how to rework this was considering the audience. This report appears to be aimed at a broad audience of those interested in the music industry general users of the platforms that belong to the association, such as Amazon, Apple, and Google. I believe that those reading the report may be interested in a high overview of the industry and not technical in language or content. 

As I moved to wireframe this new graph, I started with the original design and reworked it. I got rid of all of the labels and also created two axes in order to start to picture how a viewer might best digest the information. This was the first graph.

I then began to play with colors, trying to understand what will best show the rising trend in streaming revenues. I included some colored bars, as you can see below, but in my user feedback, the viewers were confused about the difference between the grey and the green and also were still confused about the orange line (which represents the percentage of all recording revenues attributed to streaming). Initially, I was attempting to show the years (2017-2019) that had already passed, but I decided that was not necessary and very intuitive. Moving forward, I understood that the bars staying one color would be best and also that I should use some colored text in order to evoke meaning rather than include a key that might be redundant to the viewer and distract them from the concept.

I next went to try a couple more designs and even considered separating the two styles of charts. (PICTURE and PICTURE)

The user feedback was favorable toward the dual bar graph, but the users were still somewhat confused by the two colors and how they related. So, I decided to stick with one color for the bar graph and incorporate the line graph in order to show that it was related, but was not necessarily being compared to the other - the two data sets complement each other. I also asked the users about an alternative title, and it got a favorable response. I have incorporated an updated title and subtitle in the final visualization below.
