# CRITIQUE BY DESIGN
Telling Stories With Data - Assignment 3/4

## Original Visualization
The original visualization I chose to critique comes from page 40 of the Digital Media Associationâ€™s (DiMA) Annual Music Report called [_Streaming Forward 2020_](https://15z58v1dk1tg360t7w3les8e-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DiMA_2020_Streaming_Forward_Report.pdf). I found this visualization while reading this report and it really stuck out to me. This visualization is the only image in the conclusion section and it is very crowded and busy with very little effective hierarchy. I personally did not know what to look at and had to keep reading in order to discover its full meaning. Overall, the visualization was not very effective as the last of a long report because of those reasons. My goal for this assignment was to clean this visualization up and offer the viewer all of the necessary information with the graph alone.
