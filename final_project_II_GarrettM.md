# PART II

## Wireframes

Here are the wireframes I created based on my sketches from Part I. I used Flourish for all of my visualizations here.

## Storyboard
I have drafted my story in Shorthand. This has helped me get experience using Shorthand and also aided in my user research.

## User Research and Interviews
### User Research Protocol

### Target Audiences
1) People who are unfamiliar with the severity of this issue in American orchestras yet familiar with the orchestral environment.
2) People unfamiliar with the topic in general.

### Approach & Methods
I intend to identify representative individuals by understanding who the page might be intended for and also get input from those completely unfamiliar with the topic. I expect both audiences to provide valuable information on the content and approach to this topic. I am conducting 10 to 15-minute remote or in-person interviews with selected individuals in the target audiences.

### Changes


Generally, I got great responses from both audiences about the words that come to mind about the issue. Further, the users were able to define the issue pretty clearly. I was happy to see that the unfamiliar audience was able to grasp the topic easily.


The users identified a couple target audiences. The story appeared to be applicable to a wide range of people. This has persuaded me to implement two calls to actions instead of just one. I will have one that targets arts administrators/orchestral professionals and one that targets the more general audience. I intend to include some composer diversity databases in the first call to action so that those in the field have a starting point in which to diversify. The second call to action will include links/resources for where to listen to music by diverse composers or orchestras that excel in diversity.


Based on the “clear up confusion about the topic” sentence I need to provide a little more clarity in a couple areas. Generally, my story is a little narrative-heavy, which seemed to confuse/deter the users. I intend to work on really tightening up the language and breaking some of the long sentences down. Also, I will make sure definitions I use are very clear, such as “orchestral fellowships.” The users indicated that this was associated with a “scholarship,” when it is actually a type of program orchestras can use to diversify the orchestra.


The line chart (number of women musicians vs. men) seemed to construe something positive rather than something negative, so I will work on highlighting the inequality more, possibly with the title or a more defined annotation line or shading. Further, the first graph in the “progress” section seemed to show something negative. I might take the male composer (blue) bars out to really highlight the increase in performances of works by women composers from 2014 to 2020 based on repertoire data from some of America’s largest orchestras.


I got great feedback on the first visualization; the seating chart-style graph showing white vs. non-white musicians in the orchestras from 1980 - 2014; and the graph showing the increase in the number of orchestras partnering with the Sphinx Organization.
