# PART II

## Wireframes

Here are the wireframes I created based on my sketches from Part I. I used Flourish for all of my visualizations here.

## Storyboard
I have drafted my story in Shorthand. This has helped me get experience using Shorthand and also aided in my user research.

### Target Audiences
1) People who are unfamiliar with the severity of this issue in American orchestras yet familiar with the orchestral environment.
2) People unfamiliar with the topic in general.

### Approach & Methods
I intend to identify representative individuals by understanding who the page might be intended for and also get input from those completely unfamiliar with the topic. I expect both audiences to provide valuable information on the content and approach to this topic. I am conducting 10 to 15-minute remote or in-person interviews with selected individuals in the target audiences.

This is disturbing and it is concerning as a white person that this problem persists.” \|   A good start in terms of info - explaining the history  behind diversity in American orchestras. It is very interesting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Shocked by the fact that it wasn’t that long ago \|      Words: Disappointment (in classical music and the institution) Surprise \|    Issue: the issue is the lack of representation in orchestras and how it doesn’t reflect American It shows that music is a place of privilege yet it should be accessible to all |

A wake-up call for anyone that hasn’t taken the time to really see this. Someone in the music field who would have some opportunity to make changes. Any type of person in terms of diversity, but maybe someone who is practicing music in America or a student looking to pursue higher edu in America or scholars/professors in the arts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Americans.

Are the musicians not getting the guidance? The definition of orchestra fellowships is not very clear. User wants to learn more about why is it like this? Has there been that there is no focus to fix it? Are there people holding others back? Is it white-centric because of socio-economic standards? Is it cultural? Fix quote in last paragraph of first section - somewhat confusing. Think about title for first graph - stronger word that can replace “do not reflect” - to make shorter The words lead to the graph, but took a minute to connect to see that it’s the whole population of the U.S.  Key for the first graph. Add “diverse composers” to the second paragraph of last section. | Graph with women is clear but construed as a positive thing (need to work on this graph). The women composer graph is alarming (even with the title it is alarmingly bad). Fix the sentence - too long “which is more.” Would like to learn more about more ways to improve diversity in the field.                    |

Be more clear about what type of diversity. Not 100% sure what a fellowship is. Something about awareness in all of this. Add more action items about what can come next - a little more specificity                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Shorter sentences.
