# PART II

## Wireframes

Here are the wireframes I created based on my sketches from Part I. I used Flourish for all of my visualizations here.

## Storyboard
I have drafted my story in Shorthand. This has helped me get experience using Shorthand and also aided in my user research.

### Target Audiences
1) People who are unfamiliar with the severity of this issue in American orchestras yet familiar with the orchestral environment.
2) People unfamiliar with the topic in general.

### Approach & Methods
I intend to identify representative individuals by understanding who the page might be intended for and also get input from those completely unfamiliar with the topic. I expect both audiences to provide valuable information on the content and approach to this topic. I am conducting 10 to 15-minute remote or in-person interviews with selected individuals in the target audiences.
