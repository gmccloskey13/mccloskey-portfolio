# PART I

## Outline
#### High-Level Sentence Summary and Project Intent

American orchestras must strive for increased diversity in all areas to reflect the diversity in America and, ultimately, their individual communities.

I am interested in telling the story of diversity in American orchestras from 1973 - a time when conversations around and action on this topic began - to the 2019-2020 season and present day.

#### Audience
Potential audience for this will be orchestra professionals or arts administrators more broadly. 

#### Story arc
![IMG_5260](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78331869/109432594-e57d7280-79d9-11eb-9880-54f2f0eef74c.jpg)

**Touchpoints**:
Starting the story in 1973 with orchestral fellowships designed to increase diversity in the field and the League of American Orchestras’report titled _Americanizing the American Orchestra_, published in 1993. I will then include information from two diversity studies completed by the League that collected data from its members up through 2014. I also intend to look at the diversity in the repertoire of American orchestras from 2014 - 2020 through various data sources. 

#### Structure 
I utilized the structure from Good charts ch. 8, pg. 202 and the Good Charts Workbook pg. 132.

**Setup**: The American orchestra system, bred from European ideals, is inherently white and male-dominated. These themes reverberate through orchestral musicians, staff, and performance seasons.

**Conflict**: The American orchestra does not reflect the increasing diversity in America. This lack has been illuminated by the rise of the social justice movement in the summer of 2020. Changes to certain areas have been slowly starting, but more needs to be done.

**Resolution** (call-to-action): Arts administrators and orchestra professionals need to incorporate more diverse works each season and understand how organizational operations, practices, and processes perpetuate the systemic issues present in American orchestras and other American arts organizations.

## Initial Sketches

This unit chart sketch shows that over 40 years, only 23 orchestras have hosted fellowships to increase diversity and train individuals in the field.

In these sketches I intend to show the demographic and gender breakdown among orchestra musicians, showing exactly who is on the stage performing these works. I believe that a tree map will be the best representation of this data, but I drew an additional pie chart to see how it looked and also tested some labels.

![IMG_5264](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78331869/109432699-7a806b80-79da-11eb-8f7b-955e63b19922.jpg)

Using two of the data sources I will discuss below, I want to show the increase in the number of works performed by women, underrepresented, and alive composers among Group 1 (highest budget) orchestras. 

![IMG_5265](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78331869/109432704-81a77980-79da-11eb-9307-3a5ee20f0a77.jpg)

## Data

I have located a number of sources that will help me tell this story. The first two sources come from the League of American Orchestras. This is a North American service organization with 700+ member orchestras. 

[**_Racial/Ethnic and Gender Diversity in the Orchestra Field_**](https://americanorchestras.org/racial-ethnic-and-gender-diversity-in-the-orchestra-field/)

This data source includes statistics that I can easily recreate for my own purposes in my final project. I am going to use, primarily, the data about musician demographics and genders in order to compare them to the works orchestras perform and U.S. Census data.

The original data comes from the League’s Orchestra Statistical Report, which is “the largest and most comprehensive orchestra data set in the United States." <sup>1</sup> The report analyzes Musicians: Race and Ethnicity (1980-2014), Gender (1978-2014); Conductors: Race and Ethnicity (2006-2016), Gender (2006-2016); Staff: Race and Ethnicity (2010-2014), Gender (2010-2014); Board Members: Race and Ethnicity (2010-2014), Gender (2010-2014).<sup>2</sup>


[**_Forty Years of Fellowships: A Study of Orchestras’ Efforts to Include African American and Latino Musicians_**](https://americanorchestras.org/forty-years-of-fellowships-a-study-of-orchestras-efforts-to-include-african-american-and-latino-musicians/)

This source includes an abundance of useful information about orchestral fellowship programs from the past 40 years. I will use this data to help tell the story from the implementation of the first fellowship in 1973, as I laid out in my story arc. There is useful information about the number of fellowships (as seen in my first sketch), as well as qualitative and quantitative outcomes from these fellowships that might be useful in understanding the scenario concerning a lack of diversity in orchestras today. 


The next source comes from the Institute for Composer Diversity. The [**Data Analysis of Orchestral Seasons 2019-2020**](https://www.composerdiversity.com/orchestra-seasons) database will help me understand the most current landscape of orchestral programming and provide me with quantitative data on performances featuring women, underrepresented, and alive composers. 

Similarly, the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra’s [**The Orchestra Season by the Numbers: Database**](https://www.bsomusic.org/stories/the-orchestra-season-by-the-numbers-database/) will help me complete an analysis of Group 1 orchestral repertoire from the 2014 - 2015 season in order to compare it to the 2019 - 2020 season. This information will be used in a visualization similar to the final sketch pictured above. 

## Method and Medium

I am going to work primarily in Shorthand to complete this project. I really enjoy the layouts it provides and will want to write a lot of narrative aspects given my topic. Shorthand has a very clean visual appeal that will not distract from my overall story. Moreover, the example final projects that have been done in Shorthand have looked very compelling and attention-grabbing. 

Given that I have identified relatively simple data points, some of which will just be pulled directly from the first two reports I identified, I am going to attempt to use Flourish. I used Flourish for Assignment 3/4 and enjoyed how user-friendly it is. If I intend to do some sort of map of the U.S. showing where orchestras are located, which I could see happening, I will probably use Tableau since we have already gone through one demonstration in class. If I discover that the data sets I pull from  The Data Analysis of Orchestral Seasons 2019-2020 database or the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra’s The Orchestra Season by the Numbers: Database are too unwieldy to use in Flourish, I will use Tableau. 

I anticipate that as I move through creating this project that I may have to search for new data that help illuminate my ideas about where orchestras are heading in the future. I believe that looking at recent articles detailing work American arts organizations have been doing since the pandemic has started, especially over from over the summer, will help me craft the last part of my story arc and solidify my call to action and even my audience.
