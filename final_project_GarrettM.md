## Outline
#### High-Level Sentence Summary and Project Intent

American orchestras must strive for increased diversity in all areas to reflect the diversity in America and, ultimately, their individual communities.

I am interested in telling the story of diversity in American orchestras from 1973 - a time when conversations around and action on this topic began - to the 2019-2020 season and present day.

#### Audience
Potential audience for this will be orchestra professionals or arts administrators more broadly. 

#### Story arc

**Touchpoints**:
Starting in 1973 with orchestral fellowships designed to increase diversity in the field and the League of American Orchestrasâ€™ (the League) report title Americanizing the American Orchestra, published in 1993. I will then include information from two diversity studies completed by the League that collected data from its members up through 2014. I also intend to look at the diversity in the repertoire of American orchestras from 2014 - 2020 through various data sources.
