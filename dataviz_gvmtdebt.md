#### ABOUT THESE GRAPHS
Data visualization 1 gives the audiences a comprehensive view of debt-to-GDP ratios for a single year, a snapshot of the entire data that is shown in the other two visualizations. Data viz 1 is very straightforward and takes advantage of the logical progression from low ratio to high for the countries with data in 2017. The hover-color feature is perfect for isolating the country of interest, and the label provides a bolded number so the the data can be easily found. One other great feature with the label is that it pops up from your cursor! This is good because your eye does not have to travel really at all, since someone reading it is most likely looking where their cursor is pointing. This graph has a lot of subtle features that do not distract, such as the gridlines and small increment marks.

Data visualization 2 offers the audience a comprehensive, somewhat overwhelming view of data from all countries within the years 1995 to 2019. This viz provides the same label feature that follows the cursor which is almost necessary here, as a viewer will not take the time to seek out the y-axis at the bottom of the block of graphs and trace it up to the country of interest. The same is true for the y-axis. It is very easy to get lost when trying to track each line. This graph is good for tracking some trends in data and might point a viewer where to explore further if they see something interesting. The single color of the graphs shows the eye where to go yet doesn’t put one country above the other. Further, they are very clearly in alphabetical order which helps with ease of use when looking for one particular country. 

The third visualization is one I created with Flourish. Here, the viewer/user can actually see the full range of ratios from 1995 to 2019 (where data is present) for one particular country. This was done to somewhat combine the presentation of the other two visualizations. With this one, the viewer is not overwhelmed by the amount of graphs and can easily choose from the dropdown menu the specific country they are interested in. I have gone ahead and highlighted one particular year, 2019, so that the viewer’s eye is drawn immediately to it and can visually compare 2019 to other years presented. Each column is labeled with the year and there are simple vertical gridlines for easy comparison. The label is shown at the top of each respective bar when the viewer hovers over it. This helps the viewer know where to expect the data when they move from bar to bar and compare the ratios.
