Public portfolio for my data vizzes. 

# /ABOUT ME 👨‍💻
Hello and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Garrett McCloskey (he/him) and I am currently completing my second year of the Master of Arts Management program in Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy. Over the past few years, I have spent time pivoting from performer to administrator through various arts management roles, particularly in box office, marketing, and operations. My arts management journey began at the National Music Festival in Chestertown, MD and led me to apply for this program. Currently, I am interning at Pittsburgh Festival Opera as an Artistic Operations Intern. Before coming to CMU, I earned a Bachelor of Arts in Music and Music Business Certificate from the University of Georiga in Athens, GA. 

# /WHAT I HOPE TO LEARN 📚
I hope to learn the basic data visualization principles and best practices so that I can feel comfortable creating vizzes in future positions regardless of the discipline. I hope to learn my personal preferences when it comes to free visualization tools since there are so many out there! 

# /PORTFOLIO 📊
This section of the website will house all of my data visualizations for the class and beyond.
