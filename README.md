# /ABOUT ME 👨‍💻
Hello and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Garrett McCloskey (he/him) and over the past few years, I have spent time pivoting from performer to administrator through various arts management roles. My arts management journey began at the National Music Festival in Chestertown, Maryland and the experience inspired me to pursue further education in the field through the Master of Arts Management program in Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College. I am currently completing my second year of the program and hold an Artistic Operations Internship position with the Pittsburgh Festival Opera. I hope to work in a marketing, artistic, or operations position at a performing arts center or with an orchestra in the near future, but I'll just have to see what's out there come May! Before coming to CMU, I earned a Bachelor of Arts in Music and Music Business Certificate from the University of Georiga in Athens, Georgia. I was born and raised in Charlotte, North Carolina. 

# /WHAT I HOPE TO LEARN 📚
I hope to learn the basic data visualization principles and best practices so that I can feel comfortable creating vizzes in future positions regardless of the discipline. I hope to learn my personal preferences when it comes to free visualization tools since there are so many out there! I also hope that I learn the most efficient way to find relevant data sets.
