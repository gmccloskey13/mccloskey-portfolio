## Introductory comments
A brief discussion of the purpose of today’s test: “My goal today is to get feedback on a webpage I have designed. I’m talking to people to see what makes sense and what’s confusing about the topic and the presentation. All feedback is anonymous, and the test should take less than 10 to 15 minutes of your time. I am testing the webpage to see if it is clear or not. There are no wrong answers. All feedback is greatly appreciated.”

## Main section
“Imagine I have just sent you the link to this webpage and you opened it. Can you please narrate what you see as you go through this site?”

**_During_**: 

Ask follow-up questions as necessary, encourage them to follow their own process, and respond to any questions with further discussion.

“First, what is your first reaction to this? What is going through your mind as you look at this? Please Jot down two or three of the first words that come to your mind.”

“Generally and in your own words, what issue is being discussed here?”

“Who do you think this page is intended for?”

**_After_**:

“Now that you’ve looked through this, Is there anything you would change/add/remove to make this better for you? What problems are most apparent or stuck out to you?”

“Finally, What do you find confusing? What would you like to learn more about after reading this webpage?"

## Wrap-up
“Thank you so much for your time. Do you have any questions?”
