# PART III

## CHANGES
I made a number of changes to my approach after completing the user research.

### **Narrative**
First, I tightened up the language around a lot of the narrative elements. The story is inherently narrative-heavy given the topic, but I added heading to help the reader follow along. This was a piece of feedback I received from the in-class critique that I found very feasible and useful. I think that this also gave me space to clearly define terms necessary to understand the background in the ‘Setting The Stage’ section. Some of the long sentences I referred to in Part II that needed to be addressed were replaced as I reframed my call to action. 


### **Visualizations**
I first changed the visualization titled “Women Continually Less Represented on Stages.” Originally, the yellow line was a blue line representing musicians that are men and it included a line annotation showing the female percentage of the United States in 2014 at about the 51% mark on the y-axis (derived from the U.S. Census). The final version replaced the blue line with the yellow to show that women are less represented despite the line going up. In user research, people believed that the positive line was indeed positive when I was trying to show something negative about orchestras. I made all of the above changes to reframe this. 

I also changed the graph seen in Part II titled “Performance Inclusivity Among America's Largest Orchestras.” This graph is included in the “Heading In The Right Direction” section yet it appeared to show something negative, as the blue bars overtook the pink bars and shifted the narrative. To fix this I took away blue bars (which represented music performed by male composers), and changed the x-axis, y-axis, and titles to represent the new data I pulled in. I used data from two sources about performance season repertoire performed by twenty of America’s largest orchestras. 


### **Call To Action**
The users identified a few target audiences which persuaded me to implement two call to actions instead of just one.

The first call to action is addressed toward orchestra professionals/arts administrators. I outline that these individuals can begin conversations in their own orchestras/institutions about diversity and inclusion issues with the help of resources, such as those produced by the League of American Orchestras. 

My second call to action was addressed to art-goers and the general public. This includes links to two organizations that are doing work to diversify the field of classical music.
